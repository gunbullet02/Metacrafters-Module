Challenge 3

our challenge is: add a button to disconnect from the Phantom Wallet.

Here are the steps to follow:

Complete the previous lessons and create a “Connect” button for Phantom Wallet connection.

Once you are connected, you should be able to see an address on the screen - which is the address of the current connected account.

Add a Disconnect button functionality - a button on the top right side of the screen.

Upon clicking this button, you should be disconnected from the current Phantom wallet instance and the “Connect” button should re-appear.
