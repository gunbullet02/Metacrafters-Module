The differences from what i can understand is in the break example it is much more specified in terms of the amount of parameters and given information that 
is needed for one transaction while in the hello world example it is much more step by step. The hello world example when compared to the break example seems
much more simpler while the break one is much more tedious and have a lot more information needed for the transactions. Another thing i noticed if im not mistaken
it seems that the break example uses time intervals because in the first lines of code there is a variable set for these calls while in the hello world seems not
to use these variables.

In seeing the accounts i conclude that there are countless methods that are being used for different types of transactions like close accounts and calculation 
methods that are needed. With the use of the react stack in it's code it seems to create account states that are being used for the processes and transactions
which for me is unfamilar teritory.

Overall for me from what i see is that the hello world example is much more simpler while the break one is much more detailed and have a lot of parameters for
given informations and the accounts from what i saw uses react and create different methods for different transactions. It was pretty challenging to look into
these codes but still valuable for the experience.
